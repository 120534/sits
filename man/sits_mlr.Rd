\usage{
sits_mlr(distances.tb = NULL, formula = sits_formula_logref(), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{distances.tb}{a time series with a set of distance measures for each training sample}

\item{formula}{a symbolic description of the model to be fit. SITS offers a set of such formulas (default: sits_formula_logref)}

\item{...}{other parameters to be passed to nnet::multinom function}
}
\value{
result          a model function to be passed in sits_predict
}
\description{
Use multinomial log-linear (mlr) fitting model via neural networks to classify data.
These attributes are distance metrics between patterns and observations, obtained by a distance
function in SITS (either sits_distances or sits_TWTDTW_distances).
This function is a front-end to the "multinom" method in the "nnet" package.
Please refer to the documentation in that package for more details.
