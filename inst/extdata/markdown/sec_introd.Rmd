Earth observation satellites provide a continuous and consistent set of information about the Earthâ€™s land and oceans. Most space agencies have adopted an open data policy, making unprecedented amounts of satellite data available for research and operational use. This data deluge has brought about a major challenge: \textit{How to design and build technologies that allow the Earth observation community to analyse big data sets?}

The approach taken in the current package is to develop data analysis methods that work with satellite image time series (SITS). The time series are obtained by taking calibrated and comparable measures of the same location in Earth at different times. These measures can be obtained by a single sensor (e.g., MODIS) or by combining different sensores (e.g., LANDSAT-8 and SENTINEL-2). If obtained by frequent revisits, the temporal resolution of these data sets can capture the most important land use changes. 

Time series of remote sensing data show that land cover changes do not always occur in a progressive and gradual way, but they may also show periods of rapid and abrupt change followed either by a quick recovery [@Lambin2003]. Analyses of multiyear time series of land surface attributes, their fine-scale spatial pattern, and their seasonal evolution leads to a broader view of land-cover change. Satellite image time series have already been applied to applications such as mapping for detecting forest disturbance [@Kennedy2010], ecology dynamics [@Pasquarella2016], agricultural intensification [@Galford2008] and its impacts on deforestation [@Arvor2012].

The SITS package provides support on how to use statistical learning techniques with image time series. In a broad sense, statistical learning refers to a class of algorithms for classification and regression analysis [@Hastie2009]. These methods include linear and quadratic discrimination analysis, support vector machines, random forests and neural networks. In a typical classification problem, we have measures that capture class attributes. Based on these measures, referred as training data, one's task is to select a predictive model that allows inferring classes of a larger data set. 

Current approaches to image time series analysis still use limited number of attributes. A common approach is deriving a small set of phenological parameters from vegetation indexes, like beginning, peak, and length of growing season [@Brown2013] [@Kastens2017] [@Estel2015] [@Pelletier2016]. These phenological parameters are then fed in specialised classifiers such as TIMESAT [@Jonsson2004]. These approaches do not use the power of advanced statistical learning techniques to work on high-dimensional spaces and with big training data sets [@James2013].

The SITS package uses the full depth of satellite image time series to create larger dimensional spaces. We tested different methods of extracting attributes from time series data, including those reported by @Pelletier2016 and @Kastens2017. Our conclusion is that part of the information in raw time series is lost after filtering or statistical approximation. Thus, the method we developed has a deceptive simplicity: \emph{use all the data available in the time series samples}. The idea is to have as many temporal attributes as possible, increasing the dimension of the classification space. Our experiments found out that modern statistical models such as support vector machines, and random forests perform better in high-dimensional spaces than in lower dimensional ones. 

In what follows, we describe the main characteristics of the SITS package. The first part  describes the basic data structures used in SITS and the tools used for visualisation and data exploration. Then we show how to do data acquision from external sources, with an emphasis on the WTSS ("web time series service"). The next sections describe filtering and clustering techniques. We then discuss machine learning techiques for SITS data and how to apply them to image time series. Finally, we present validation methods.
