\description{
\code{sits_table} returns an empty sits table
A sits table is a tibble with pre-defined columns that
has the metadata and data for each time series. The columns are
<longitude, latitude, start_date, end_date, label, coverage, time_series>
}
\details{
Most functions on the sits package use a sits table as input (with additional parameters)
and a sits table as output. This allows for chaining of operation on time series
}
