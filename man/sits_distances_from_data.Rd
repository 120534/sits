\title{Use time series values from a sits tibble as distances for training patterns}
\usage{
sits_distances_from_data(data.tb = NULL, patterns.tb = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data.tb}{a SITS tibble with original data}

\item{patterns.tb}{Set of patterns obtained from training samples}
}
\value{
distances.tb  a tibble where columns have the reference label and the time series values as distances
}
\description{
This function allows using a set of labelled time series as
input to the machine learning models. Instead of first estimating a set
of idealised patterns and then computing distances from these patterns,
the attributes used to train the model are the series themselves.
This function then extracts the time series from a SITS tibble and
"spreads" them in time to produce a tibble with distances.
