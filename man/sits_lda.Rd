\title{Train SITS classifiction models with Linear Discriminant Analysis}
\usage{
sits_lda(distances.tb = NULL, formula = sits_formula_logref(), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{distances.tb}{a time series with a set of distance measures for each training sample}

\item{formula}{a symbolic description of the model to be fit. SITS offers a set of such formulas (default: sits_formula_logref)}

\item{...}{other parameters to be passed to MASS::lda function}
}
\value{
result          either an model function to be passed in sits_predict or an function prepared that can be called further to compute multinom training model
}
\description{
This function receives a tibble with a set of attributes X for each observation Y
These attributes are usually distance metrics between patterns and observations
It performs a linear discriminant analysis (lda) to obtain a predictive model.
This function is a front-end to the "lda" method in the "MASS" package.
Please refer to the documentation in that package for more details.
